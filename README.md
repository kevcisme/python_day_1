# Hello World!

This is a tutorial series on Python. If you follow along with the days in the repo, you can Pythonista your way into web development, statistical analysis, or just automating boring tasks around the office. 

Me:
Kevin. Used to be small. I'm much bigger now. I work as a data scientist where I use Python a lot.  

You:
Have no exposure to Python or want to start from scratch. You may know another language, you may not. 

No biggie either way, smalls.
This is my change
We:
Both subscribe to the Buddhist "Beginners Mind" concept. I can't wait for you to teach me something!
